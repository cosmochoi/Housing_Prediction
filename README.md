# Housing_Prediction
Predicting house prices using different machine learning models

The dataset is from the Kaggle dataset, adapted from The Ames Housing dataset compiled by Dean De Cock. It contains features of houses in Iowa Ames, including exterior quality, square footage, and number of rooms. 
This project aims to predict housing prices based on these features, using Multiple Lienar Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVR.
